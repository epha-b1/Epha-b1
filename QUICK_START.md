# 🚀 Quick Start - Never Miss Your GitHub Streak!

## 🎯 Choose Your Method

### Method 1: GitHub Actions (RECOMMENDED ⭐)

**Pros**: Always works, doesn't need your computer on, most reliable
**Cons**: Visible in commit history as bot commits

**Setup** (Takes 2 minutes):

1. Commit and push the `.github/workflows/auto-commit.yml` file
2. That's it! It will automatically run twice daily

```bash
cd /home/someone/Documents/Fetan_System_Technology/Epha-b1
git add .github/workflows/auto-commit.yml
git commit -m "Add auto-commit GitHub Action"
git push
```

**To test immediately**:

- Go to your GitHub repository
- Click "Actions" tab
- Select "🔥 Keep Streak Alive" workflow
- Click "Run workflow"

---

### Method 2: Local Cron Job

**Pros**: Commits look like they come from your local machine
**Cons**: Requires your computer to be on

**Setup** (Takes 3 minutes):

```bash
# 1. Make script executable
chmod +x /home/someone/Documents/Fetan_System_Technology/Epha-b1/auto_commit.sh

# 2. Test the script
/home/someone/Documents/Fetan_System_Technology/Epha-b1/auto_commit.sh

# 3. Open crontab
crontab -e

# 4. Add these two lines (10 AM and 6 PM daily):
0 10 * * * /home/someone/Documents/Fetan_System_Technology/Epha-b1/auto_commit.sh >> /home/someone/Documents/Fetan_System_Technology/Epha-b1/cron.log 2>&1
0 18 * * * /home/someone/Documents/Fetan_System_Technology/Epha-b1/auto_commit.sh >> /home/someone/Documents/Fetan_System_Technology/Epha-b1/cron.log 2>&1

# 5. Save and exit (Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter)
```

## 🎨 Customization Options

### Change Commit Times

#### For GitHub Actions:

Edit `.github/workflows/auto-commit.yml` and modify the cron schedule:

```yaml
schedule:
  - cron: "0 8 * * *" # 8 AM UTC
  - cron: "0 20 * * *" # 8 PM UTC
```

**Common UTC times**:

- `'0 6 * * *'` - 6 AM UTC
- `'0 12 * * *'` - 12 PM UTC (Noon)
- `'0 18 * * *'` - 6 PM UTC
- `'0 23 * * *'` - 11 PM UTC

**Note**: GitHub Actions uses UTC time. Convert your local time to UTC!

#### For Cron Jobs:

Edit your crontab and change the hour value:

```bash
# Pattern: MINUTE HOUR DAY MONTH WEEKDAY
0 9 * * *   # 9 AM
0 21 * * *  # 9 PM
```

## 🔍 Monitoring

### Check if it's working:

**GitHub Actions**:

```bash
# Visit your repo on GitHub → Actions tab
```

**Cron Jobs**:

```bash
# View recent commits
cat /home/someone/Documents/Fetan_System_Technology/Epha-b1/streak_tracker.log

# View cron execution log
cat /home/someone/Documents/Fetan_System_Technology/Epha-b1/cron.log

# List active cron jobs
crontab -l
```

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### GitHub Actions not running?

1. Make sure the workflow file is in the correct path: `.github/workflows/auto-commit.yml`
2. Check if Actions are enabled: Repo Settings → Actions → General → Allow all actions
3. Push the workflow file to the main/master branch

### Cron job not working?

```bash
# Check if cron service is running
sudo systemctl status cron

# Start cron if not running
sudo systemctl start cron

# Check system logs
grep CRON /var/log/syslog | tail -20
```

### Authentication errors?

```bash
# For SSH (recommended)
ssh -T git@github.com

# For HTTPS
git config --global credential.helper store
```
