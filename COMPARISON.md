## üéØ Recommendations

### Use GitHub Actions if:

- ‚úÖ You want 100% reliability
- ‚úÖ Your computer is not always on
- ‚úÖ You travel frequently or use a laptop
- ‚úÖ You want zero maintenance
- ‚úÖ You don't mind bot commits in history
- ‚úÖ You have a public repository

**Best for**: 95% of users who want a "set it and forget it" solution

---

### Use Cron Jobs if:

- ‚úÖ Your computer is always on (desktop/server)
- ‚úÖ You want commits to look like they're from your local machine
- ‚úÖ You prefer local control over cloud solutions
- ‚úÖ You're comfortable with Linux/cron

**Best for**: Users with servers or always-on machines

---

## üí° Pro Tip: Use BOTH!

For maximum reliability:

1. Set up GitHub Actions as your primary method
2. Set up Cron Jobs as backup
3. Configure them at different times

**Example configuration**:

- GitHub Actions: 10 AM and 6 PM
- Cron Jobs: 2 PM and 10 PM

This gives you **4 commit attempts per day** = near-zero chance of missing streak!

## üåç Timezone Configuration

### GitHub Actions (UTC Time)

GitHub Actions uses UTC. Convert your local time:

| Your Time | UTC Time             | Cron Expression |
| --------- | -------------------- | --------------- |
| 8 AM EST  | 1 PM UTC             | `'0 13 * * *'`  |
| 8 AM PST  | 4 PM UTC             | `'0 16 * * *'`  |
| 8 AM CET  | 7 AM UTC             | `'0 7 * * *'`   |
| 8 AM IST  | 2:30 AM UTC          | `'30 2 * * *'`  |
| 8 AM JST  | 11 PM UTC (prev day) | `'0 23 * * *'`  |

### Cron Jobs (Local Time)

Cron uses your system time - no conversion needed!

```bash
# Simply use your local hours
0 8 * * *   # 8 AM your time
0 20 * * *  # 8 PM your time
```
